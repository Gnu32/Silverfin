About the CAPS Service:
	
The CAPS Service is an internal Aurora.Service service that is used to control what CAPS the region has access to control.
This service is used to provide grid-wide CAPS that are secure, even in an open-grid setting.
By using this service, you (the grid operator) can control what CAPS the regions can use.
