===========  AURORA ==============
==================================

The Aurora Development Team is proud to present the release of Aurora virtual world server.
 The Aurora server is an OpenSim derived project with heavy emphasis on supporting all users, 
 increased technology focus, heavy emphasis on working with other developers,
 whether it be viewer based developers or server based developers, 
 and a set of features around stability and simplified usability for users.

We aren’t just releasing new features, but a new outlook on a virtual world development for the average human.
 We encourage you to read our manifesto (http://aurora-sim.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20&Itemid=60)
 and learn about our direction to make the people’s choice in virtual server!

---- Configuration ----
-----------------------

- Configuration in Aurora is a bit different than in other distributions of OpenSim. 
In Aurora, all configuration files (except for AuroraServer.ini and Aurora.ini) 
have been moved to the AuroraServerConfiguration and Configuration folders (respectively) and further subdivided from there into categories of .ini files.

---- Standalone Configuration ----
-------------------------

- To run Aurora, you will need to edit a config file for it to run. This file is:

bin/Aurora.ini

- You will need to modify the [Network] section, specifically the HostName parameter.
- By default, the line is "HostName = http://127.0.0.1" and if you want to allow other users
     besides yourself to connect to your instance, you will need to change this to your external IP, which can be found 
     at http://www.whatsmyip.org/.


-------------------------
---- Starting Aurora ----
-------------------------

- To Start the simulator part of Aurora, just double click on Aurora.exe (if you are running a 64 bit machine and operating system, click on Aurora.32bitLauncher.exe). It will run for a bit until you come to a screen that will help you interactively configure your new region.

------------------------------
---- Connecting to Aurora ----
------------------------------

- To connect to the simulator with Imprudence, you must add a new grid to the Grid Manager.
 Click on the Grid Manager button, and in the new popup, click "Add".
 In the loginURI space, put "http://<IP>:9000/" where "<IP>" is your IP.
 If you arn't sure what your IP is, you can check at http://www.whatsmyip.org/. 
 After this, set a name for your grid in the Grid Name area.
 Then press apply and close the box. Select the grid you just created and then login with your username and password and enjoy!

in the Router Configuration section for more information on ways to resolve this issue.
