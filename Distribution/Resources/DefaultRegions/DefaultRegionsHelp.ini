This folder contains .abackup files and images for them that are used by the region database loader, which offers the user a selection of pre-made regions  when they create a new region.  To add a new region to the list, copy an .abackup file into this directory and an image  of the region, and rename the image so that it has the same name as the .abackup file (except for the extension). It will then be  added to the list.
